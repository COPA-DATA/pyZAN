# Mini Tutorial - Timeseries prediction with LSTM
#
# For questions please contact: support@copadata.com
#
# The tutorial is based on the zenon project PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_DEMO_820.
# In that project a simple simulation creates cyclic welding data.
# To follow this tutorial you will need:
#   - a zenon supervisor > V 8.20 to run the project
#   - a zenon analyzer > V 3.40  set up with a filled meta db for the project
#   - pyZAN installed (pip install CopaData)
#
# Prediction (or better: forecasting) a timeseries is not an easy task. There
# are a lot of different algorithms you can use, that rely on 
# statistics/analytics. Examples would be SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing or
# any kind of linear regression. These algorithms all have their strengths and
# weaknesses and are suited better for certain kinds of timeseries data.
# In an "usual" data science workflow, you would have a look at your data and
# its metrics and select an algorithm based on things like stationarity.
# So sadly there is no single algorithm, that can do it all... but maybe one,
# that can do a lot. Although in most cases using LSTM
# (Long-Short-Term-Memory) neural networks for timeseries forecasting is a little
# overkill, it will in my experience deliver mostly good results.
#
# In this tutorial we will load data from the PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_DEMO_820 
# zenon project and train a LSTM network to forecast data
# for the next welding cycle(~30 seconds).

# ---------------- Part 1 - Read trainig data ----------------

# First connect to our analyzer
zan = pyZAN.Server(server='localhost', metadb='ZA_Predictive820')

# Get projects, archives and variables
projects = zan.read_MetaData_Projects()
archives = zan.read_MetaData_Archives()
variables = zan.read_MetaData_Variables()

                                                        
# We will focus on R1_WeldingCurrent and use 1 hour of data for training

train_data = zan.read_Online_Archiv(project_reference = "PREDICTIVE_MAINTENANCE_DEMO_820",\
                                 archive_reference = "PA",\
                                 variable_references = ["RobotSimForPA/Global/R1_WeldingCurrent"],\
                                 time_from = datetime.datetime(2019,12,3,7,20,0),\
                                 time_to = datetime.datetime(2019,12,3,7,50,0),\
                                 show_visualnames=True)



# Our zenon data has a lot of really usefull columns like STATUSFLAGS and UNIT
# For our simple purposes we don't need them... we'll discard all columns but VALUE
train_data = train_data[['VALUE']].VALUE.values.reshape(-1,1)
train_data = np.array(train_data)

# I will save my train dataset.. you could just load it and won't need the zenon
# environment
#train_data = np.load("train_data.npy")

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------- Part 2 - Reshape the data ----------------
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# When working with any kind of neural network it is usually a good idea to
# to normalize your data to a fixed interval. In this case we will scale it to
# the interval [0,1]
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range = (0, 1))

train_data_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(train_data)

# We want to predict at least 35 seconds of our timeseries. To do this there are
# two different approaches:
#   1) Use n values from the past to predict the value for T+1.
#      Repeat that process using your own predictions as input values to predict
#      T+2, T+3, T+4 ...
#   2) Use n values from the past to predict values for the sequence [T+1,T+35]
# As you can imagine sequence prediction is a lot more challenging for a
# ml model. While using your own predictions as inputs will bring the disadvantage
# of stackig errors.
# We will train a model for each approach and see which one is better.


# When training an neuronal network in most cases you will have to provide two
# arrays of data. One will be the "features", which is the input-data for your
# model and has the same form as the data you will provide to the model later on
# when you want it to calculate a prediction. In our case this will be the values
# from the last 35 timesteps. (35 because we know, that one cylce has roughly
# 32 seconds, so 35 seconds hold at least one complete cycle and should be
# engough for our model to derive the current position in that cycle)
# Corresponding to these features you will have to provide the "labels", or the 
# "ground truth" to the model. During training your model we (hopefully) learn
# how the features influence the labels and will then be able to calculate correct
# predictions for a new set of features presented to it.
# In our case the labels will be the value for T+1 or the values for [T+1,T+35]
# depending on our approach.

# We will now build those datasets. For each second in our dataset we will create
# one row in our features and labels.
# The features will be the same for both models, labels1 will hold the labels 
# for our first model, labels35 for the second

features=[]
labels1=[]
labels35=[]

for i in range(34,train_data_scaled.size-35):
    features.append(train_data_scaled[i-34:i+1,0])
    labels35.append(train_data_scaled[i+1:i+36,0])
    labels1.append(train_data_scaled[i+1,0])

# convert both to np arrays
features = np.array(features)
labels35 =  np.array(labels35)
labels1 =  np.array(labels1)

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# ----------------- Part 3 - the LSTM models ------------------
# ------------------------------------------------------------

# each LSTM network will need a 3 dimensional array as input, with dimensions:
# 1 = nr of rows in the dataset
# 2 = nr of columns / timesteps we're looking back
# 3 = nr of features... only 1 in our case

features = np.reshape(features,(features.shape[0],features.shape[1],1))

# I will save my features and labels, so you can use them without the need for
# the zenon environment

#features = np.load("features.npy")
#labels35 = np.load("labels35.npy")
#labels1 = np.load("labels1.npy")

# create our first model
model1 = Sequential()

# we will combine 3 LSTM layers with one dropout layer each. The dropout layer
# will prevent overfitting to a certain extent, by ignoring a percentage of the
# neurons of the preceding layer.
model1.add(LSTM(units=35, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(features.shape[1], 1)))
model1.add(Dropout(0.2))

model1.add(LSTM(units=35, return_sequences=True))
model1.add(Dropout(0.2))

# --- optional layer---
model1.add(LSTM(units=35, return_sequences=True))
model1.add(Dropout(0.2))
# ---optional layer---

model1.add(LSTM(units=35))
model1.add(Dropout(0.2))

# a dense layer for output
model1.add(Dense(units = 1))

# compile model
model1.compile(optimizer='adam', loss = 'mse')

# finally it's time to train our first model
# depending on your hardware and the setup of your model this can take a while
# The 3 layer version should take about 30 min on an i7, 4 layers will need up
# to 4 hours
# Training will consume a lot (all) of your memory.
# Sometimes memory isn't freed correctly after training, this will make the next
# training crash the python kernel on most computers
# Restarting the kernel, reloading our dataset and proceeding with the second
# training works usually
# I saved my trained models, so you can load them...
model1.fit(features,labels1,epochs=200)

# since this took a while lets save our trained model to disk
model1.save('LSTM Model 1_4Layers.h5')

# you can load your model later with
#model1 = load_model('LSTM Model 1_4Layers.h5')

# create our second model
model2 = Sequential()

model2.add(LSTM(units=35, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(features.shape[1], 1)))
model2.add(Dropout(0.2))

model2.add(LSTM(units=35, return_sequences=True))
model2.add(Dropout(0.2))

# --- optional layer---
model2.add(LSTM(units=35, return_sequences=True))
model2.add(Dropout(0.2))
# --- optional layer---

model2.add(LSTM(units=35))
model2.add(Dropout(0.2))

model2.add(Dense(units = 35))

# compile model
model2.compile(optimizer='adam', loss = 'mse')

model2.fit(features,labels35,epochs=200)

# since this took a while lets save our trained model to disk
model2.save('LSTM Model 2_4Layers.h5')

# you can load your model later with
#model2 = load_model('LSTM Model 2_4Layers.h5')
